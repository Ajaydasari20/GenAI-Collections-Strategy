## 📊 Key Insights

- **Missed Payments**, **Credit Utilization**, and **Credit Score** are strong predictors of delinquency.
- Customers with more than **3 missed payments** and **>75% utilization** are at highest risk.
- Early interventions can significantly reduce delinquency rates and financial losses.
